create plan to implement this for now: 

Code changes (not yet done)
Add a short TTL cache on /api/news responses (e.g., 5–15s) to smooth spikes.
Add lightweight rate limiting on public routes (e.g., /api/news) to curb per-user spamming.
Verify/add DB indexes for hot filters/search (slug, publishedAt, categoryId, status, text search fields).
Optional: add a debounce (250–400ms) on /news search input for extra client-side smoothing.
Consider more ISR/SSG where possible; keep SSR only where needed.

but make sure the change adhere and do not break our current structure which is prisma ORM, supabase and vercel. VERY IMPORTANT.
